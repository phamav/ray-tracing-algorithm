# Computer Graphics Ray-tracing Project
This is my repository for the implementation of ray-tracing for 3D objects. It's written C++ with openGL Mathematics.

The code base is provided to me. Here are the functions/features that I implemented.

1. Objects: Plane, Cylinders, Cones, and Spheres.
2. Functions: All mathematical and basic functions for rendering the scence and the raytracing algorithm.
3. Features: Lightings (position and spotlight), shadows, anti-aliasing, attenuation, curved image textures, resizing, and reflection.

Below is some examples of the scene:
