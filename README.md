# Computer Graphics Ray-tracing Project
Basic implementation of ray-tracing for 3D objects. 

## about
Project for CSE 386: Computer Graphics
Taught by Norm Krumpe
Made with C++ in XCode

## features
1. Objects: Plane, Cylinders, Cones, and Spheres.
2. Functions: All mathematical and basic functions for rendering the scence and the raytracing algorithm.
3. Features: Lightings, shadows, anti-aliasing, attenuation, curved image textures, resizing, and reflection.
